Classify 20 fruits using a deep neural network model. The model is built by fine-tuning *ResNet50* pretrained on *ImageNet* data set. Specifically, prediction layers of *ResNet50* were removed; two custom dense layers were added on top which have been further trained using the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits/data.
